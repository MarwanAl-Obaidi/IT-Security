# 17 Cybersecurity Forensics Quiz

### What two parts is cybersecurity forensics commonly split into?

- [ ] User Forensics
- [X] Computer Forensics
- [X] Network Forensics
- [ ] Security Forensics
- [ ] Encryption Forensics

### How does network steganography work.

- [ ] The data is sent to a client encrypted and then provided with a steganographed message which unencrypts the file.
- [ ] A file is first inserted with hidden data and then transported over the internet to the client.
- [ ] The data is encrypted before being sent to the client and then unencrypted at the client.
- [X] A protocol used for network communication is inserted with hidden data.

### What of the following are Cybersecurity Forensics most commonly used for? (2 our of 4)

- [ ] Used to determine if there are any infected computers on a network.
- [X] Used to determine if employees have been conducting any actions that may point to data theft.
- [X] Used to prove guilt in a court of law.
- [ ] Used to determine if there are any vulnerabilities on a system.

### What does computer forensics focus on?

- [ ] Gaining forensic information only on storage media.
- [ ] Gaining forensic information only on computers.
- [ ] Gaining forensic information on network devices.
- [X] Gaining forensic information on devices and systems used to store data.

### How can someone performing forensics on storage media determine if data has been overwritten by a program designed for it.

- [ ] Physically examine the storage media to determine if data has been overwritten.
- [ ] By checking the operation system logs for any changes in the data.
- [ ] They can check if other applications have ever pointed to specific sectors on the storage media.
- [X] Applications often use predetermined repetitive patterns to overwrite data which can be detected.

### How should RAM be stored in case data needs to be recovered by the machine has been shut down.

- [ ] Stored in a vacuum.
- [ ] Stored in hot temperature.
- [X] Stored in cold temperature.
- [ ] Stored in room temperature.

### If a forensic team had to figure out what had been done on a device, which of the choices would be the most likely thing they would look at first.

- [ ] The devices security settings.
- [X] The devices operating system's event and logging information.
- [ ] Security footage of the premises.
- [ ] Network information for that device.

### What does network forensics heavily rely on?

- [ ] Redundancy in the network.
- [X] Pre-existing logging.
- [ ] Accurate documentation about the network.
- [ ] Proper network configuration.

### What problems may there be with network forensics?

- [ ] Network forensics can only be conducted during a attack.
- [X] Network forensic information may be deleted without leaving a trace.
- [ ] Network forensics is limited by the the network itself.
- [ ] Network forensics requires a lot more time than computer forensics.

### What is a limiting factor of steganography in files?

- [ ] It is easily detectable by forensics researches when conducting scans of the system.
- [X] The size the file that data is being hidden in determines how much hidden data can be inserted.
- [ ] It can only be done in one file-type.
- [ ] The steganography process may often corrupt the data being hidden or the file that the data is being hidden in.
