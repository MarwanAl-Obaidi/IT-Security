# 21 Data Center Quiz

### Why is resource redundancy required for data centers?

- [X] So if one system fails, there is a failover system to keep the data center operational.
- [ ] Can be used for other sections of the facilities when they aren't in use.
- [ ] It's a cheaper option for the data center than having a single line.
- [ ] To make the data center work faster.

### What should be implemented for applications running on the network?

- [ ] Encryption of patching and updating data.
- [ ] Plans for using applications.
- [ ] Efficiency and resource management for applications.
- [X] Automated patching and updating services.

### Why is high availability of the devices used in a data center important?

- [ ] It makes the devices more secure from attacks.
- [ ] It increases the redundancy of the the network.
- [ ] Data centers do not actually require high availability.
- [X] Because it reduces downtime of the data center.

### Besides having two lines for electricity to the data center what could be implemented to secure the electricity resources required?

- [ ] Implementing PoE to the network devices.
- [X] Using a UPS as a failover system.
- [ ] Constructing alternative sources of energy to the data center such as wind or water energy.
- [ ] Constantly repairing and maintaining the electrical grid from the place providing it to the data center.

### What should be taken into consideration in the air ventilation system of a data centers facilities?

- [ ] Have the system cleaned and checked daily to keep it from getting damaged or failing.
- [X] Have the system recirculate the inside air so no contaminants damage the equipment.
- [ ] Have the system pump in fresh air to make sure it's comfortable for the employees
- [ ] Have the system both recirculate and pump in new air to lower costs.

### Why is logging important in the physical security of data centers? (2 out of 4)

- [X] Use to determine if someone has entered on hours outside their work schedule.
- [ ] Determines if anyone without authorization has entered the system.
- [X] Keeps records of who, where and when has accessed the facilities, which can be used to determine who to question if something happens.
- [ ] Use it to determine if employees have been noting down the incorrect work times.

### Why should the walls of the facilities housing the equipment of a data center be reinforced and thick.

- [ ] To ensure the data center is sturdy and safe from earthquakes.
- [X] To protect the equipment from weather and bombs.
- [ ] To protect the personnel from stray bullets.
- [ ] ,To protect the outside environment in case the data center has an accident such as an explosion.

### What can network redundancy be used for besides having failover options.

- [ ] Intrusion prevention
- [X] Load-balancing
- [ ] Intrusion detection
- [ ] Monitoring

### Which of the following is the most important for data center network security.

- [X] Visibility
- [ ] WLAN security meassures
- [ ] MAC address filtering
- [ ] Cooling

### What should be done with applications implemented in the data center?

- [X] Audited and scanned for vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Applications should not be implemented at all.
- [ ] They should be segmented from all other applications and networks.
- [ ] They should be redundant to all parts of the network and users.
