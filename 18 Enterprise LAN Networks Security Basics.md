# 18 Enterprise LAN Networks Security Basics Quiz

### Which statement describes why services running on the network should be taken into consideration in network security the most accurately. (2 out of 4)

- [X] Since services running on the network may be insecure and have a better alternative service.
- [ ] Since some services running may be malicious services made by a hacker.
- [X] Since unused services could be leveraged by attackers for intrusion or disruption.
- [ ] Since all services by default are insecure.

### Which of the following statements is a correct practice to implement for interface security.

- [ ] Interfaces should be accessible for everyone in the enterprise.
- [ ] All interfaces should be configured to the same subnet so all devices can communicate with eachother.
- [X] Unused interfaces should be disabled and enabled depending on when they are needed.
- [ ] Unused interfaces should be left enabled at all times for fast access.

### Why is segmentation of the network important for network security. (2 out of 4)

- [X] It allows networks to be managed efficiently and their security policies to be personalized based on the segmentation.
- [ ] It allows the administrator to divide devices into malicious devices and legitimate devices.
- [ ] It allows all the networks to efficiently communicate with each other for better logging.
- [X] It allows devices on specific networks to only be able to access specific networks.

### How does redundancy benefit networks security? (2 out of 4)

- [ ] Stops DDoS attacks by routing the attack into a null interface. 
- [X] Provides alternative paths for packets in case a device in unable to function due to attack or hardware failure.
- [ ] Stop intruders from gaining access the devices on the network by alternating paths.
- [X] Mitigates DDoS attacks by providing alternative routes in case a devices is out of action.

### Which statements are true regarding MAC address filtering. (2 out of 5)

- [ ] WLAN MAC address filtering is effective due to how hard they are to spoof.
- [X] Spoofing a MAC address filter requires the spoofer to use a white listed MAC address.
- [ ] Two devices can never have the same MAC address
- [X] MAC address filtering provides ports and WLAN APs the ability to limit access based on a devices MAC address
- [ ] Ethernet port based MAC address filtering is ineffective due to how easy it is to spoof.

### Which of the following statements is the most accurate when describing the usefulness of security cameras to secure Enterprise LAN network security.

- [ ] Security cameras are only useful for active monitoring.
- [X] Security cameras are useful for recording, monitoring and as a psychological preemptive measure.
- [ ] Security cameras are only useful for recording incidents.
- [ ] Security cameras are useful for both recording and monitoring.

### Why is multi-factor personalized physical access important for Enterprise LAN security?

- [X] Allows people access to specific rooms in the facilities that they have authorization to enter and use more than one form of authentication to enter.
- [ ] Allows everyone working in the facilities to have access every room in facilities.
- [ ] Allows people with authorization to only use one authentication method to get in, making access easier for authorized personnel.to access rooms in the facilities.
- [ ] Allows everyone, including guests having access to every room in the facilities except them entering and leaving is logged.

### Which statement describes why physical security for a LAN network is important the most accurately.

- [X] The attacker can circumvent security measures set at the network edge such as firewalls, IDS and IPS devices.
- [ ] The attacker can conduct the attack more stealthily.
- [ ] The attacker doesn't have to visit the premises.
- [ ] The attacker can enter the premises at gunpoint and steal all your information.

### Which of the following choices describe a Firewall most accurately.

- [X] A device or software that permits and rejects packets based on analyzing the packet header.
- [ ] A device or software that rejects packets based solely on predefined IP addresses.
- [ ] A device or software that rejects packets based on analyzing the entire packet including the payload and detecting a malicious packet.
- [ ] A device or software that logs packets based on analyzing the entire packet including the payload and detecting a malicious packet.

### Which of the following choices describe a IDS most accurately.

- [ ] A device or software that permits and rejects packets based on analyzing the packet header and detecting a malicious packet.
- [X] A device or software that logs packets based on analyzing the entire packet including the payload and detecting a malicious packet.
- [ ] A device or software that rejects packets based solely on predefined IP addresses.
- [ ] A device or software that rejects packets based on analyzing the entire packet including the payload and detecting a malicious packet.
